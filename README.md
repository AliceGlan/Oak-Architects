# Oak Architects

Oak Architects' site has been designed for two Architects, early in their careers, aspiring to set up their own practice. The site has been designed to communicate to potential clients, who they are, what services they can provide, and a portfolio of their previous work. It is a celebration of them.

The target audience for this site will be private potential clients, other architecture firms, and possibly other architects searching for work. As a creative target audience, we have used lots of high-quality imaging. The clients guided their font and colour scheme preferences, whilst also providing the imaging and content they wanted to be displayed.

The site will allow easy access through images and information, whilst also allowing the user to connect with the business through social media and a contact us page.

Oak Architects' website is designed to be responsive, knowing that users may access and use this website on a range of different devices.

## Features

<!-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future: -->

### Features Left to Implement

## Testing

<!--  In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

### Validator Testing
<!--
- HTML

- CSS -->


### Unfixed Bugs

<!--  You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. -->

## Deployment

<!--  This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

## Credits

<!--  In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project. -->

### Content

<!-- reference where all the content is from, including any tutorials used -->

### Media
<!-- explain where the media (images) are sourced from -->
