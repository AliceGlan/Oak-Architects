# Oak Architects

Oak Architects' site has been designed for two Architects, early in their careers, aspiring to set up their own practice. The site has been designed to communicate to potential clients, who they are, what services they can provide, and a portfolio of their previous work. It is a celebration of them to build their client base and get themselves clients for their business.

Oak Architects' website is designed to be responsive, knowing that users may access and use this website on a range of different devices.

## User Experience (UX)

Oak Architects is an online portfolio of work for potential clients or work opportunities. It is a portfolio of work designed to show off the architects' skills, personalities, architectural styles, and examples of work.

Oak Architects are made up of two newly qualified architects with aspirations to start their practice together. They wish to begin by deploying a website that displays their work and skills before fine-tuning their business and its marketing.

## Design

I wanted to experience the process of designing a website for a client. My sister needed a website and I took the opportunity. Whilst the client had input into the design, we both worked through the design aspects together, simulating a real-world experience.

### Colour Scheme 
The client wanted to use earthy tones throughout the website. I have added a colour pallet created thorough

## Features

<!-- In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

The live link can be found here -  -->

## Testing

<!--  In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->

### Validator Testing
<!--
- HTML

- CSS -->


### Unfixed Bugs

<!--  You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. -->
